Added Nodes
Added the suggested Bass and Treble nodes to the visualizer

Added Sprites
Added two classes, Square and Triangle, to the canvas.js file. They both draw (as expected) squares and triangles to the canvas. 
They do so in a similar fashion to the circles, in that they “pulsate” with the audio based on the byte values of the audio data.

JSON
Added the required title, track information, and metadata (i.e., both the track locations and their names). In addition, added 
information for the default state of the checkboxes and the visualizer selection (frequency or waveform)

Aesthetics

I added visualization effects for both of the added Bass and Trebles nodes to the canvas (both bars, either overlapping with the 
bars we made or added to the top of the visualizer). In addition, I changed the gradient (per requested) to be less obtrusive to 
the visualizer. Finally, I added functionality for my newly added Sprites that gives the user the ability to turn them on and off 
(checkboxes).

Overall I felt as though I put a lot of work into the functionality, but I admit I would not be incredibly eager to put this on my
portfolio. I tried messing with some other things but simply wasn’t happy with the end result, so I omitted those changes (mostly 
messing with randomization and changing the default circles). I’m self rating myself somewhere in the middle. I actually really 
liked the visualizer for the most part with all its options before, so I didn’t omit any. 
My score: 8%
